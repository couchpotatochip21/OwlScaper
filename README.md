# OwlScaper
An Open-Source web scraper for TheOwlClub.net.

# INSTRUCTIONS
# 1. Install Python (if you don't have it)
Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you have not already (CHECK ADD PYTHON TO ENVIORNMENT VARIABLES IN INSTALLER)
# 2. # Install dependencies (command line)
  ```pip install selenium, webbrowser, time, os, glob```
# 3. Download [owlscraper.py](https://github.com/couchpotatochip21/OwlScaper/blob/main/owlscraper.py)
# 4. Create an `owlscraper` folder
Create a folder in your Downloads folder called `owlscraper` (this program is currently windows only)
# 5. (optional or in case of partial failure) Customize Settings
Open owlscraper.py in an IDE such as Notepad++ or VSCode and change the settings to start on a different season/episode, or disable name reformatting (Jellyfin compatible)
# 6. Run owlscraper.py
Run `owlscraper.py` and leave your computer to download. If you choose to continue using your computer it will not kill it instantly but it will open browser windows in your face repetively and if you misclick in one of those windows it can halt the program.

# Instructions have ended, no information beyond here is an instruction

# NOTE FOR FUTURE CONTRIBUTERS / MAINTAINERS
I do not suggest removing the many `time.sleep`'s I have added. I know they seem inneficient but it is important to have extra delay to prevent accidental DDOS.
